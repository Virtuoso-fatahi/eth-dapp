# Projectstake Academy Intro to Web3 Course Final Project

## Introduction 📝
This project is the culmination of concepts learned during weeks 1-4 of the Projectstake Academy's Intro to Web3 course. It demonstrates the practical application of Web3 development concepts.

---

## Overview ✍️
The project consists of two major tasks:
1. Implementing a simple **SendETH DApp** using `ethers.js`.


---

## Aim 🎯
The primary goal of this project is to create a simple DApp with two core functionalities:
- **Send Ethereum**: Transfer Ethereum from one account to another.

---

## Features 📝
### 1. Connect Wallet
- Prompts users to connect their wallet through the **MetaMask** browser extension.
- Displays the **address** and **balance** of the connected wallet.

### 2. Send Ethereum
- Users can enter the recipient's address and the amount of ETH to send.
- Clicking **"SendETH"** transfers the specified amount of ETH to the provided address, provided the inputs are valid.

## How to Test the App 👨‍💻

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v20 or later)
- **A text editor (for example, VS Code)**
- **MetaMask**
- **npm version 9+**
- **The MetaMask extension installed**
- **Basic knowledge of TypeScript and React**

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Install MetaMask Extension
- Available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Brave browsers.

#### 2. Install Node.js
- If Node.js is not already installed, download and install it from the [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org).

#### 3. Install NPM
- Use the following command to install npm:
  ```bash
  npm install
### 4. Run the Application
- Open the app using this link: [Projectstake Web3 Final Project](https://)

### 5. Connect Wallet
- Click **"Connect Wallet."** MetaMask will prompt you to connect an account. By default, it connects to the first Ganache account.

### 6. Test SendETH Functionality
- Use the app to send ETH from one account to another.
- Verify the balance updates in MetaMask.


## Achievements 🏆
Through this project, I have:
- Learned how to connect to the Ethereum blockchain.
- Interacted with smart contracts using ethers.js.
- Gained experience with testing tools like Ganache, Infura, and the Sepolia testnet.
- Learned how to deploy a project to Vercel.
